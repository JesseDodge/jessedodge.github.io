            Jesse Dodge is a Senior Research Scientist at the
            <a href="https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for AI</a>, on the
            <a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team, working on
            natural language processing and machine learning. He is interested
            in the science of AI and AI for science, and he works on
            reproducibility and efficiency in AI research. He is involved in
            many parts of <a href="https://olmo.allen.ai/">OLMo</a>, a project
            to create fully open large language models, including creation of
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00159.pdf">Dolma</a> (a
            web-scale training dataset),
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10523.pdf">Palmoa</a> (an
            evaluation benchmark for language models), and incorporating ethical
            principles at every stage of the machine learning pipeline. His
            research has highlighted the growing computational cost of AI
            systems, including the environmental impact of AI and inequality in
            the research community. He has worked extensively on improving
            transparency in AI research, including open sourcing and documenting
            datasets, data governance, and measuring bias in data. He has also
            worked on developing efficient methods, including model compression
            and improving efficiency of training large language models. His PhD
            is from the Language Technologies Institute in the School of
            Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He created the NLP
            Reproducibility Checklist, which has been used by five main NLP
            conferences, including EMNLP, NAACL, and ACL, totaling more than
            10,000 submissions, he helped create the
            <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/responsibleNLPresearch/"
              >Responsible NLP Checklist</a
            >
            which is used for submissions to
            <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/">ARR</a> (replacing the
            Reproducibility Checklist), and was an organizer for the
            <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/rc2022"
              >ML Reproducibility Challenge 2020-2022</a
            >. His research has won awards including a Best Student Paper at
            <a href="best student paper">NAACL 2015</a> and a ten-year Test of
            Time award at

              He earned his PhD in Spring 2020 from the LTI at CMU, though spent
              much of his PhD as a visiting student at UW CSE in Seattle. His
              PhD advisor was
              <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/">Noah Smith</a>.
              As an undergrad he worked with
              <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/">Luke Zettlemoyer</a
              >. In 2011 he participated in the

              where he worked with a host of fantastic people on the
              <a href="http://tamaraberg.com/CLSP11/">vision and language</a>
              team (and got a great sweatshirt). He was a research intern for
              six months in 2015 at Facebook AI Research in NYC with
